# Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation progress of the String Art Simulator web application.

## Implemented Features

*   **Core Application Framework:**
    *   A static web application with an HTML shell, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic.
    *   A modular structure with UI logic in `main.js` and algorithm logic in `algorithms.js`.
    *   A testing environment using Mocha and Chai has been set up in the `tests` directory.

*   **Greedy Residual Algorithm:**
    *   The algorithm is fully implemented and integrated into the UI.
    *   It uses a generator-based approach to avoid blocking the main thread during computation.
    *   The implementation has been developed using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, with unit tests for all its components.

## In-Progress / Planned Features

*   The `string_art_algorithm_guide.md` lists several other algorithms to be implemented.

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### 1. Performance Issues with Complex Algorithms

*   **Problem:** The **Continuous Relaxation** and **Simulated Annealing** algorithms are too computationally intensive to run in the browser in this environment. The verification scripts for these algorithms consistently time out, even with significantly reduced problem sizes.
*   **Root Cause:** The algorithms require a large number of calculations (e.g., matrix operations for Continuous Relaxation, full image re-rendering for Simulated Annealing) that are too slow when implemented in vanilla JavaScript running on the main UI thread.
*   **Workaround/Status:** Both the "Continuous Relaxation" and "Simulated Annealing" algorithms have been **disabled** in the UI to prevent the application from freezing. The code for these algorithms remains in the repository as a foundation for future work, which might involve:
    *   Significant performance optimization of the core calculations.
    *   Moving the computation to a Web Worker to avoid blocking the UI thread.
    *   Offloading the computation to a backend server.

### 2. Unreliable Functional Testing

*   **Problem:** The Playwright-based functional tests have been very unreliable, frequently timing out due to the performance issues mentioned above.
*   **Workaround/Status:** The project now has a unit testing setup (`tests/test.html`) which is a more reliable way to verify the correctness of the algorithm logic in isolation from the UI and performance of the browser environment. Future development should prioritize unit tests for all algorithmic components.
